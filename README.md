## Objective

Design and deploy an interactive To Do List that connects to a local JSON file to read and write user submitted tasks
The project should run in a CLI, deployed via Heroku, using Python.

***This project was created to expand my knowledge of the Python programming language, and to satisfy the requirements for my Portfolio Project 3 assessment at Code Institute***

## Brief

### Tu_Du_

The goal of this app is to provide the user with an easy to use, interactive to do list, to help them be more productive throughout the day.

The app should:

- Be programmatically error free
- Be written using Python
- Handle all user input errors gracefully and appropriately
- Give clear instructions regarding use and valid inputs
- Store user inputted data in a JSON file

## UX &#8722; User Experience Design

### User Requirements

Some example user stories which will affect the design

#### First Time User

> *"As a procrastinator, I would like to write down my daily goals to keep track of them"*
>
> *"As an organised person, I would like to create different lists to separate my tasks into categories"*
>
> *""*
#### Returning User

### Initial Concept

I intend to build a to do list inspired by the app Todoist on the Apple App Store. While my app will not be anywhere near as sofisticated, I plan on using either a JSON file to store the lists locally, and then use Python methods to read, write and remove data from the JSON file. To me this works in a similar fashion to connecting with a google sheets API, however having done that in the "Love Sandwiches" guided project, I thought using JSON would be an added challenge as I haven't worked with it as a separate file before.

#### Wireframes

Due to the nature of this project the wireframes are very basic. There is only
one page and the design does not change across any devices, only a change in
content.

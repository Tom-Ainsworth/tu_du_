        Thank you for choosing Tu_Du to organise your tasks. Here is a guide on
        how to get the most out of Tu_Du_
        
        To navigate the app, use the arrow keys on your keyboard, and then press
        'Enter' to confirm your selection.

        The main menu gives you the following options:
        1. Create a New List
        2. Show Existing Lists
        3. Instructions Page (where you are now)
        4. Save Lists
        5. Reset Lists 
        
        1. 'Create a New List' does exactly that. It will create a new Tu_Du_
        list which can then be populated with as many tasks (Tu_Du_s) as
        you wish.
        
        2. 'Show Existing Lists' will display all of the Lists that have
        been created, including an Example List so you can see
        how a pre-made List looks. From here you can select a List or
        return to the main menu. If you opt to select a List, you get
        the following options:
        
            1. Add a Tu_Du_
            2. Complete a Tu_Du_
            3. Return to the Main Menu.
        
            'Add a Tu_Du_' will prompt you to name a new task to add to the
            current list.

            'Complete a Tu_Du_' will show you all of the tasks in the list,
            and let you choose which one you would like to complete.
        
            'Return to Main Menu' will take you back to you back to the start.

        3. 'Instructions Page' will bring you here, where
        you're hopefully learning how to use the app.

        4. 'Save All Lists' will commit all current lists and Tu_Du_s to
        memory, for use at a later time.

        5. 'Reset All Lists' will revert the app back to the beginning, where
        only the Example List will appear. If you relaunch the app without
        Saving your Lists, they will be lost.

        I hope you enjoy using Tu_Du_
        I had a lot of fun building it!

        Thanks for trying it out,
        Tom

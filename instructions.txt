Thank you for choosing Tu_Du to organise your tasks. While every attempt to 
simplify the app has been made, here is a guide on how to get the most out of 
Tu_Du_

As you have hopefully realised by getting to this page, you navigate the app 
using the arrow keys on your keyboard, and then press 'Enter' to confirm
your selection.

The main menu gives you the following options:

Create a new List

Show Existing Lists

Save Lists

Reset Lists

Show Instructions Page - where you are now.

Create a new list does exactly that. It will create a new Tu_Du_ list which can
then be populated with as many tasks (Tu_Du_s) as you wish.

Show existing lists will display all of the lists that have currently been 
created, including an Example list so you can see how a pre-made list looks.
From here you can select a list or return to the main menu. If you opt to
select a list, you get the following options:

Add a Tu_Du_

Complete a Tu_Du_

Return to the Main Menu.


Add a Tu_Du_ will prompt you to name a new task to add to the current list.

Complete a Tu_Du_ will show you all of the tasks in the list, and let you
choose which one you would like to complete.

Return to Main Menu will take you back to you back to the start.
